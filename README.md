## Phase 2 User Stories

- As a user, I want the option to save my updated schedule to a file.
- As a user, I want to be given the option to load from a file or use a new open schedule.

## Initial Questions

**What will the application do?**
- The application will allow users to book different sport activities for different time periods. They will have to check the schedule for available courts and pick a valid time. They will also be able to rent equipment, having a price and a quantity. 

**Who will use it?**
- This project would be used by a recreation facility that wants to schedule court times. If the facility wants, they can add options for rental equipment that can be purchased.

**Why is the project of interest to you?**
- I used to play squash and spend a lot of time at my local recreation center. It would be fun to make a project that would let users make bookings, it would also be fun to figure out the graphical interface for a booking system.
